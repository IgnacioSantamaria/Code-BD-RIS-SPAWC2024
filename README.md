# Code-BD-RIS-SPAWC2024
This is a code package related to the paper "MIMO capacity maximization with beyond-diagonal RIS"  I. Santamaria, M. Soleymani, E. Jorswieck, J. Gutierrez, submitted to SPAWC 2024.

# Content of Code Package
The code is implemented in Matlab, you might need cvx (with all subfolders) to run the code.
The files Script_SPAWC24vsBDRISposition, Script_SPAWC24vsM, ScriptSPAWC243vsPower and ScriptSPAWC24_Convergence are scripts that reproduce some of the plots in the paper. The programs compare the Max-capacity BDRIS algorithm proposed in the paper with a single-connected RIS, optimized using the algorithm in S. Zhang, R. Zhang, "Capacity characterization for IRS aided MIMO Communications", JSAC, vol. 38, no. 8, pp. 1823-1838, 2020.

The main function to optimize the BD-RIS is MaxCap_BDRIS_passive.
The main function for optimizing the diagonal RIS is MaxCap_RIS_passive.
